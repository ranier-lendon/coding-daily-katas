# Coding Daily Katas

This repository contains my personal solutions to coding challenges from [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/).

### Purpose
- I'm using this repo to practice **Java fundamentals** through consistent problem-solving.
- This is part of my learning journeyâ€”not a showcase of perfect or optimized code.
- If you're here looking to copy solutions: this isn't for you. Try solving them yourself first.

### Note
Some of the solutions may not be the most efficientâ€”and thatâ€™s totally fine. My focus is on learning, improving, and showing up daily.

Feel free to browse or learn, but donâ€™t expect production-level code. Feedback is welcome, but I'm not chasing perfectionâ€”I'm chasing progress.
